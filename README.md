# Drought Ender's Cave Creator 

## 1. Cave Editor

### Accessing Caves

#### Open Cave
Opening caves is pretty simple, simply click **Open Cave** and go to the location in which your cave is stored and double click on the .txt file.

#### New Cave
**New Cave** will jump you straight into the editor with a completely blank cave, where you can save your cave to a location immediantly

#### Load Backup
**Load Backup** will route you to the _Backups_ folder, in which backed-up _.pickle_ files will be stored, clicking on one of them will load the backed-up cave.

### Saving Current Cave

#### Save As

To save the current cave to a new location, select **File -> Save As** or use **Ctrl + Shift + S**, this will open a dialoge to save the file the a desired location.

#### Save

To overwrite the cave that is being worked on, select **File -> Save** or use **Ctrl + S**, this will overwrite the file that is saved over, so be careful.

#### Backup

To backup to the backups folder, selected **File -> Backup** or use **Ctrl + B**, this will create a *.pickle* backup that can be easily loaded.
##### Note:
pickling is not a secure method of storage, do not accept *.pickle* files from people you do not trust.

### Reading the GUI

#### Floors
In the top center of the cave editor is an enumerated bar of the floors within the cave. Left of that bar is two buttons, one that says *Add Floor* and one that says *Remove Floor*, their functions are self explanatory

##### Note:
Remove a floor by accident? Do not fear, the floor itself is not deleated, clicking *Add Floor* will return the floor back before it was deleated.

#### Floorinfo
